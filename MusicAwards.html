    In 2017 when Luke first made his way onto the music scene, Luke got nominated for a CMT Music Award and a CMA Award, but didn't win. 
    2018, Luke finally won his first award from the iHeartRadio Music Awards, claiming the New Country Artist of the Year award. Later that year he also won a CMA award for New Artist of the Year. In 2019, Luke got nominated for the Best New Artist at the Grammys but unfortunately didn't win. In 2019, Luke won seven awards total, including the most recent CMA's for Male Vocalist of the Year and Song of the Year. To quote Luke on the Male Vocalist of the Year award, "This is pretty unbelievable stuff. I remember sitting on my parents' porch when I was a little kid and watching Vince Gill come up here and whin this same award." For his Song of the year speech, "First off, I want to thank these guys for writing an incredible song with me. And my beautiful fiancee for being the inspiration behind this song." The day after the award show, Luke sent out an email to his fans stating this: "I don't know where to start. I'm so thankful to have had my parents, fiance, friends, team, and crew with me last night. It was a dream come true; something I never thought would happen to a guy like me. To my beautiful fiance Nicole, thank you for being the inspiration behind "Beautiful Crazy." This is something we'll be able to have together forever. When I first posted the song in 2016, it took on a life of it's own and that was because of y'all- the best fans in the world. I also wanted this for Rob and Wyatt, two great people and friends. I get to be on stage and talk and be heard all of the time, but the people who help me do that don't necessarily always get the credit I feel like they deserve. Country music means everthing to me and last ngiht was a moemnt I'll never forever. Thank you guys so much. -Luke."
